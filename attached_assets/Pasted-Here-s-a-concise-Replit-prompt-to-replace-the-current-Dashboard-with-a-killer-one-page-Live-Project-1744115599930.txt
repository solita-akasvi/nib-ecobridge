Here’s a concise Replit prompt to replace the current Dashboard with a killer one-page “Live Project” view. It integrates ESG metrics (E, S, G) and color-coded ratings, shows a project description, and includes AI-generated insights powered by GPT-4o-mini. Keep the same style as other screens; a 1440 x 960 layout is ideal.

Replit Prompt: Killer “Live Project” Page
Replace the current Dashboard screen with a new single-page “Project View” that displays:

Project Title & Short Description (e.g. “SolaraGrid Renewables”).

Color-coded ESG ratings for Environment, Social, and Governance (Low, Medium, High, Critical).

Key ESG Metrics (E, then S, then G), each with sub-points (1–6 for E, 7–11 for S & G) and a quick rating (A-D or color-coded).

AI Insights: A short summary panel for each ESG area (E, S, G), generated from GPT-4o-mini (important to specify the cheaper mini model).

Design/UX:

Keep left nav (Dashboard, Analytics, etc.) consistent with the current style.

At the top: Big title, short project description.

Below: A three-column or tabbed layout for Environment, Social, Governance, each showing:

Sub-metrics with a short label and a color-coded pill (A-D or Low-High).

“AI Insights” box for that category (when user clicks “Generate Insights” or auto-generate).

Right side: small chart/graph or progress ring with overall ESG performance (optional).

Possibly add a button to “See Full ESG Analysis” for deeper drill-down.

Implementation:

Preload the page with a sample project card (e.g. “SolaraGrid Renewables”) and mock data for each metric.

Use GPT-4o-mini with your OpenAI key to generate short bullet-point insights. Example call:

js
Copy
// Example pseudo-code
const response = await openai.createChatCompletion({
  model: "gpt-4o-mini",
  messages: [
    { role: "system", content: "You are an ESG analyst..." },
    { role: "user", content: "Analyze these metrics..." }
  ],
  // ...
});
Keep the layout minimal and visually appealing; remember you only have 3 minutes to demo.

That’s it! This ensures your hackathon “killer page” has a clear, investor-ready view with ESG ratings, AI insights, and a crisp design.
